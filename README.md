# React Webpage Project

This is my attempt at creating a webpage using React. I initially tried using Jekyll, but realized that it may not be the right tool for my needs. Since my projects will have user interfaces and require dynamic and reactive websites, I decided to explore React instead. If I discover that Jekyll is a better alternative, I will rebuild the project and learn more about it.

## What I'll Learn

This project will help me improve my skills in the following areas:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- The React suite
- The Redux addon for React
