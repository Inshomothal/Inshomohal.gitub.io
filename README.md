This is the react attempt to creating my webpage. I tried Jekyll and learned that it may not be the tool suite I want to use since my projects will have user interfaces and require dynamic and reactive websites. If I learn otherwise, I will rebuild the project and learn more about Jekyll as an alternative. 

This project should teach me more about:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- The React suite
- The Redux addon for React.
